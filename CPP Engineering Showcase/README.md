Our team was chosen to present our research in Post-Quantum Stateful Hash-Based Signatures to represent the ECE department at Cal Poly Pomona's Engineering Project Showcase for 2021. The Engineering Project Showcase is a joint event that runs alongside the Engineering Project Symposium where Cal Poly's Engineering students present their projects. The Showcase is held on the same day - April 30, 2021 - but each Showcase team is selected to represent their respective engineering department. 

The presentation covers the following topics:
1. Our Motivation
2. Background on Post-Quantum
3. Post-Quantum Signatures
4. Leighton-Micali Signature Scheme (LMS)
5. Compatible Hash Functions
6. Bluetooth Security
7. Our Goal
8. Test Results
9. Demo
10. Future Works
