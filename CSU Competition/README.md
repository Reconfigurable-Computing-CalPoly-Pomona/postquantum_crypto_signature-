Our team presented our research in post-quantum stateful hash-based signatures at the 9th annual Cal Poly Pomona Student Research Conference (RSCA) in 2021. The team participated in and won the competitive Engineering and Computer Science category. As a result, we were chosen to represent Cal Poly Pomona at the 35th Annual CSU Student Research Competition where we will compete against all 22 other Cal State Universities.
